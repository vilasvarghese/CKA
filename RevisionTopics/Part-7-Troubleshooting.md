This is largely dependent on the application in question and what’s being leveraged in terms of the Kubernetes infrastructure, but from a top level.

**Pods**

**<code>kubectl get pods </code></strong>- Get the pods currently running and their status

**<code>kubectl logs nginx-web </code></strong>- Get stderr/stdout from pod

**<code>kubectl describe pod nginx-web </code></strong>- Get detailed information about a pod, including the steps that were required to run it, for example pulling images, assigning to nodes, etc.

```


**Services**


```
kubectl get services
kubectl describe service kubernetes
```


When diagnosing services, particularly those which are only accessible internally (the default service type) spin up a pod to which you can exec into to run tests.


```
kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh
```


At which point tools such as ping/telnet

**Deployments**

Refer to part 2 under “Manage cluster component logs” to identify the log locations/journalctl commands for the various k8s cluster components.

Refer to “CKA Curriculum Part 2 - Logging and Monitoring” for troubleshooting the controller components via log files or journalctl.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Troubleshoot networking</span>**

Refer to “CKA Curriculum Part 2 - Logging and Monitoring” for troubleshooting the CNI.

In addition:



*   Spin up a pod for testing internal cluster networking (service IP)
*   Describe pods/services to ensure the correct endpoints are being added
*   Ensure pods/services are exposed on the correct port
*   Exec directly into pods and run commands locally
