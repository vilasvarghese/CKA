**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Understand the Kubernetes cluster upgrade process</span>**

Kubeadm is likely going to be the tool of choice to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster. Firstly, define the version you wish to upgrade to, or find the latest stable release:


```
export VERSION=$(curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)
export ARCH=amd64
```


Download the latest version of kubeadm


```
curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/${ARCH}/kubeadm > kubeadm
```


Install Kubeadm


```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 ./kubeadm /usr/bin/kubeadm
```

Alternatively, use apt

```
apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.14.x-00 && \
apt-mark hold kubeadm
```


Then, execute a upgrade plan


```
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT       AVAILABLE
Kubelet     3 x v1.13.0   v1.14.1

Upgrade to the latest stable version:

COMPONENT            CURRENT   AVAILABLE
API Server           v1.13.5   v1.14.1
Controller Manager   v1.13.5   v1.14.1
Scheduler            v1.13.5   v1.14.1
Kube Proxy           v1.13.5   v1.14.1
CoreDNS              1.2.6     1.3.1
Etcd                 3.2.24    3.3.10

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

       kubeadm upgrade apply v1.14.1

As the output implies, execute the kubeadm upgrade command (under root/sudo) to apply the changes

linu
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[upgrade/version] You have chosen to change the cluster version to "v1.14.1"

[upgrade/prepull] Will prepull images for components [kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler etcd]
[upgrade/prepull] Prepulling image for component etcd.
```


After which, kubeadm will start pulling down updated container images and deploy those to your cluster.

If you run a kubectl get nodes on your cluster following a kubeadm upgrade apply command, you’ll notice that the version listed hasn’t changed:


```
NAME            STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
k8s-master-03   Ready    master   22h   v1.13.0
k8s-worker-03   Ready    <none>   22h   v1.13.0
k8s-worker-04   Ready    <none>   22h   v1.13.0
```


Recall from the kubeadm upgrade command:


```
Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT       AVAILABLE
Kubelet     3 x v1.13.0   v1.14.1
```


The version number from kubectl get nodes refers to the kubelet version. As the tool implies, you need to upgrade this manually.

The following needs to be done on each node. Note the kubelet service needs restarting after the new binary has been implemented.


```
export VERSION=$(curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)
export ARCH=amd64
curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/${ARCH}/kubelet > kubelet
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 ./kubelet /usr/bin/kubelet
sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service
```

Alternatively, use apt:
```
apt-mark unhold kubelet && \
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.14.x-00 kubectl=1.14.x-00 && \
apt-mark hold kubelet
```
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Facilitate Operating System Upgrades</span>**

Occasionally upgrades have to be made to the underlying host that’s facilitating your pods. To do this in a graceful way, we can do the following.

Get a list of nodes running on which node


```
kubectl get pods -o wide

Drain the pods from the node:

kubectl drain k8s-worker04 --ignore-daemonsets

node/k8s-worker-04 cordoned
WARNING: Ignoring DaemonSet-managed pods: kube-flannel-ds-amd64-hq4wh, kube-proxy-cqpst
pod/nginx-7db9fccd9b-tdpx7 evicted
pod/coredns-fb8b8dccf-hj5km evicted
node/k8s-worker-04 evicted
```


As we can see, the non daemonset pods have been evicted and the host has been cordoned. This will apply the “SchedulingDisabled” flag on the node


```
kubectl get nodes
NAME        	STATUS                	 
k8s-worker-04   Ready,SchedulingDisabled
```


At this point, complete the required maintenance activities. Even if you reboot, the node will still be in a “SchedulingDisabled” state.

To release the node back to scheduling duties, uncordon the node:


```
kubectl uncordon k8s-worker-04
```


At which point it will be ready:


```
kubectl get nodes
NAME        	STATUS                	 
k8s-worker-04   Ready
```


**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Implement backup and restore methodologies</span>**

In a Kubernetes cluster there are two main pieces of data that need backing up:



*   Certificate Files
*   Etcd database

**Backing up certificate files**

Back up the /etc/kubernets/pki directory. This can also be done as a cronjob, and contains the following files:


```
/etc/kubernetes/pki$ ls
apiserver.crt          	
apiserver.key             	
ca.crt  
front-proxy-ca.crt  	
front-proxy-client.key
apiserver-etcd-client.crt  
apiserver-kubelet-client.crt  
ca.key  
front-proxy-ca.key  	
sa.key
apiserver-etcd-client.key  
apiserver-kubelet-client.key  
etcd	front-proxy-client.crt  
Sa.pub
```


**Backing up etcd**

**Take a snapshot of the DB, then store it in a safe location**


```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshot.db --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key
```


Verify the backup:


```
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshot.db
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|   HASH   | REVISION | TOTAL KEYS | TOTAL SIZE |

+----------+----------+------------+------------+
